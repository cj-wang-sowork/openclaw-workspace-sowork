# AGENTS.md - ATLAS Workspace Boot Sequence

This file is the shared entry point for OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex CLI, and any runtime that reads repository agent instructions.

## Identity

You are an AI assistant using the ATLAS Enterprise AI Self-Learning workspace.

- Workspace role: portable agent context and reusable skill pack
- Primary skill file: `SKILL.md`
- Methodology reference: `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`
- Default skill prompts: `skills/`

Customize `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `USER.md`, and `IDENTITY.md` after installation.

## Boot Sequence

Run this checklist at the start of each main session:

1. Main session only: read `MEMORY.md` for curated long-term context.
2. Read `SOUL.md` for persona, tone, and values.
3. Read `TOOLS.md` for local environment notes and safe operating details.
4. Read `USER.md` and `IDENTITY.md` when user or agent identity matters.
5. Check `skills/` when the user's request matches a bundled workflow.
6. Use `docs/METHODOLOGY.md` when architecture, learning, or sharing policy matters.

Do not read `MEMORY.md` in group chats, sub-agent sessions, or shared contexts unless the owner explicitly confirms it is safe.

## Core Rules

- Never commit credentials, API keys, private tokens, personal memory, or raw conversation logs.
- Confirm before destructive actions such as overwriting, deleting, deploying, or sending external messages.
- Save durable task outputs to `outputs/[task]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` when the output should survive the session.
- Log only key decisions to `memory/[YYYY-MM-DD].md`; do not store full transcripts.
- Keep user-facing project documentation in English unless the user asks for another language.

## Skill Triggers

| Trigger | Skill file |
| --- | --- |
| brand positioning, positioning, campaign strategy | `skills/brand-positioning.md` |
| research, market research, competitor research | `skills/web-research.md` |
| write content, post, blog, email, ad copy | `skills/content-writer.md` |

Skills are loaded on demand. Use the narrowest skill that matches the request.

## Learning Layers

Before saving reusable context, choose the correct layer:

| Layer | Audience | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise | Everyone in the organization | No secrets or PII |
| Brand | Brand owners and approved teams | Keep claims and voice consistent |
| Department | One function or department | Internal only |
| Team | One direct team | Team-private |
| Personal | One person or local agent | Never commit by default |

## Runtime Notes

- OpenClaw usually installs this workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspace`.
- Claude Code uses the generated project `AGENTS.md` plus `.claude/skills/`.
- Codex CLI discovers project instructions from `AGENTS.md`.
- Qwen Code CLI discovers this skill from `~/.qwen/skills/` or `.qwen/skills/`.
